<h1>delivery_web_app</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
  The project represents japanese kitchen food delivery, which are very popular in present time.
  This is my first experience in web development. Ordinary idea, but i tried to implement it with all features from references.
  I've used following stack:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flask</li>
  <li>SQLite/PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>JQuery</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
<h2>Available functionality</h2>
<p>The following functionality is currently available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Registration with phone number confirmation. Password reset also requires code from sms.</li>
  <li>Menu system with different categories and foods in them.</li>
  <li>User profile with personal info, addresses, favourite foods and orders history.</li>
  <li>Cart system. You can add and remove any items from menu, increase and decrease quantity in your cart.</li>
  <li>Order checkout system. Use your saved addresses or add new, choose delivery day and time, write additional info.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Heroku</h2>
<p>The project was deployed on heroku and currently available. I highly recommend visit site and try app by yourself. It works quite slow sometimes, because of server-side rendering and probably not optimized SQL queries.</p>
